						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> From this article, I learned how quickly our brains perceive images and objects based on
							four key ideas: emergence, reification,
							multi-stability and invariance. These four ideas accumulate on top of each other, more or
							less: with emergence, our brains will first recognize
							some kind of general outline of the object/image; subsequently, reification will make what
							we think we're perceiving more concrete
							as our brains will naturally pattern-match and make similar associations based on
							accumulated memory. With multi-stability, our brains will
							essentially bounce back and forth with more ambiguous-looking objects/images as we are able
							to perceive the same thing in multiple ways which
							could trip people up as people become more accustomed to seeing one image versus the
							other(s). Finally, invariance allows our brains to identify
							objects regardless of what varying shape or form they can take on (i.e. a 2-d vs 3-d die: we
							still can tell it's a die regardless of its dimensionality). </p>
					</li>

						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article was learning about the origins of the Gestalt principles. I
							found it particularly interesting how
							the word "Gestalt" has German origins and means "form" or "shape" and how a group of German
							psychologists banded together in the 1920s
							to somehow organize the way the brain perceives objects into six distinct ideas. I also
							found insightful the idea that a whole entity is
							perceived as greater than the sum of its components as it brought me to consider the impact
							of organizing smaller elements into one bigger
							and more meaningful picture. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "[Your brain] has its own “weird” way of perceiving shape and form, grouping information,
							fill in the gaps to draw the big picture." </p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a
							five, please briefly explain why.</p>
						<p> I would give this article an 8/10. I found it pretty insightful and interesting the way our
							brains work when we perceive objects even when it
							all happens very, very quickly as we are technically doing this every moment of our lives. I
							think having a fundamental understanding of the
							Gestalt priciples can come a long way in web designing or even just visually designing
							anything in general; by having such an understanding, we
							can use them to our fullest advantage in not only conveying our messages across but also
							make influential calls to action. </p>
