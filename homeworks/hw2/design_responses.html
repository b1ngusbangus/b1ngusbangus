						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned just how important it is to consider white space in web design. Despite the beliefs of white space being wasted space, 
								it in fact draws users to focus their attention on these elements as it brings them out clarity. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was how the author addressed the Medium website itself as an excellent example of using white space in order
								to make a point about the significance of using this notion well. I found myself indeed taking in all the white space on my large computer screen
							    whilst reading the article. More importantly, it further convinced me just how great having white space is--although having a lot of it is a luxury. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool. </p>
							<p> "Think of white space as a breath of fresh air. Just as humans need air to breathe, designs need white space 
								to breathe. Yes, this may sound corny. But I stand by this." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I would give this article a 9/10: not only did the author make clear points regarding the significance of white space but I enjoyed
								the analogy of us as humans needing space to breathe fresh air so we don't feel cramped or overwhelmed with our surroundings. This is 
							    just the same for looking through websites or mobile apps: less white space makes it overwhelming and unpleasant for the user to navigate them
								as they are effectively forced to figure out what is what. </p>
