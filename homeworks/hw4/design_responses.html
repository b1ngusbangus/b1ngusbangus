							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about the importance of designing one's website in order to make it accessible to everyone, including
								the colorblinded and visually impaired. This article stressed for the need to have enough contrast with the colors 
								so that users can easily read different elements on the website. Additionally, it illustrated the importance of not
								relying solely on color to communicate information or instructions (i.e. a user fills out an invalid keyword in filling
								their credentials in a cell box -> don't just make the surrounding borders red but have a little description elaborating
								on what exactly the issue is and how to resolve it). </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was where the author demonstrated a website's usage of patterns on top of solid colors to
								make visuals like graphs or charts more readable specifically for colorblinded people. I just thought it was pretty cool how 
								the designer realized the importance of accessibility and consideration for all kinds of people. When we don't have any kind of
								impairments that affect our daily lives such as the handicapped, it's very easy to take our functioning health for granted and 
								forget that there are people out there with chronic disadvantages that add an additional challenge to their daily lives. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Also, not creating accessible products is just rude, so don't be rude." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I'd give this article an 8/10: it was pretty insightful as it stressed the significance of taking accessibility into account 
								when designing websites (or just about anything, really). I also found the quote of not creating accessible products to be rude
								a little quirky but also true. </p>
