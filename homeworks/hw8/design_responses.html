					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> From this article, I learned that people who invented and utilize dark patterns on the web
							are knowledgeable in human psychology and know how to effectively deceive innocent users. I
							found this piece of information to be rather scary as these malicious people know how to
							achieve
							their ulterior motives through deceptive web patterns that a number of people using the
							internet
							or web have not learned about, realize or become aware of. As these deceptive UX designers
							are most
							likely cognizant of this, they have often become effective in utilizing dark patterns and
							tricking users
							into doing something they really don't mean/want to do. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article was where the article talks about the dark pattern
							"misdirection" as I found
							this section particularly insightful when it comes to user behavior. In the example the
							article provides, we see
							a Skype software update pop-up that includes a checkbox making Bing as the default search
							engine. Users don't read
							things but scan them as they most often will want to proceed as quickly as possible and get
							over whatever is in their
							way. Malicious UX designers knew this all too well and used this knowledge to their
							advantage: when users clicked the install
							button they have no idea that unwanted plug-ins and other software were being downloaded
							into their computer. I thought this
							really brought into light one key aspect of user behavior, which is that users do not read
							things carefully if something appears
							long or complicated to understand, and UX designers use this to their overwhelming
							advantage. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "But every UX designer knows that people don’t read, they scan. What happens, in the end, is
							that people only look at the window for enough time to find the buttons that will make the
							installation go through and they click ‘ok’ or ‘next’ without giving it much thought." </p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a
							five, please briefly explain why.</p>
						<p> I would give this article a 9 out of 10. In all honesty, I believe more people need to learn
							about
							the concept of dark patterns and how prevalent they are on the internet especially as our
							society
							today predominantly revolves around it. I think it is important to know and be aware of
							possible
							deception on the internet and always be able to criticically think about what is going on
							whenever
							you especially see something that appears random or suspicious. By having a significant
							number of people
							become more aware of this issue, we can reduce the number of cases where users find
							themselves into a
							situation they don't want to be in especially because of the fact that they weren't aware or
							criticically
							thinking about these dark patterns that deceive frighteningly well. </p>
