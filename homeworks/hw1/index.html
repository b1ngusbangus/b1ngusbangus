    <h3> ˖ ࣪ A little spiel about myself... (totally not taken from my app) </h3>

    <section>
        <p>
            Hi! I’m Jacqueline (she/her), a second-year originally from the eastern
            suburbs of Los Angeles. I am fully Vietnamese; as I know of many people who
            are unable to actively engage with their culture from never having learned
            their mother tongue, I am extremely grateful to be able to speak the language
            as a child of endeavoring immigrants (not super fluently but definitely enough
            to get by). I’m also into the aesthetics of pixel graphics and design,
            specifically with arcade games from the 80s-90s and Stardew Valley (love that
            game). I’m also really into fashion and thrifting—I recently dropped a rather
            considerable amount of money on three pieces I thrifted from that one vintage
            store on Telegraph but I believe it was worth. Styling different outfit,
            silhouette and color scheme combinations provides me a creative outlet where I
            can really explore what I find cute or expressive to my liking at the moment—and
            bring out self-confidence!

        <h3><em> 1. What is something you learned from this article? </em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li> From this article, I learned about how detailed a precise the process of designing
                a UI interface is. For example, considering wording choice: how can adding/removing
                a word affect use cases in positive/negative ways? </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><em> 2. What was your favorite part of this article? </em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Favorite part of this article was how the author encourages readers interested in
                web/mobile app design to start analyzing different apps' layouts and design whenver
                possible; could be while you're waiting in line for something or waiting to meet a
                friend. It also encourages you to actively consider the designers' intentions via
                their app layouts as a self-aware user, which I think is something interesting to
                think about. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><em> 3. Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool. </em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li> "Next time you’re sitting in a Lyft or waiting on a friend, open up an app and think
                through the reasons why the designers chose to design it that way. " </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><em> 4. On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If
                you scored below a five, please briefly explain why. </em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li> I would give this article an 8/10: generally, I would say I'm the type of person who
                likes to consider things that a number of people might not put much thought into, such
                as one's place in the world and how their circumstances and environment may have brought
                them to become the person they currently are. In short, I like to consider perspectives
                outside of my own and I found it cool that this article brought some new insight on something
                most people probably don't really think about, in terms of app layouts (i.e. choice of
                subheading content). </li>
        </ul>
