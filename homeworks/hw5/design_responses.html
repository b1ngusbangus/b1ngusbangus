                        <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                        <p> From this article, I learned about the various animations and transitions when a user
                            clicks/views different
                            parts of the website. I saw how much web designers paid attention to detail as specific
                            parts of elements within
                            the image coordinate together with others, whether at same or different speeds. I also
                            observed how the elements
                            within each of the GIFs moved when a user clicks an element: it often had a smooth kind of
                            effect which I could
                            imagine to enhance user experience via the fluidity of element transitions. </p>

                        <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                        <p> Even though this seems rather silly, my favorite part of the article was the captions below
                            the GIFs. I liked how
                            they clarified what exactly was happening transition-wise and from there I could note how
                            they were achieving those
                            animations and why they decided to make those animations in such a way. Essentially, these
                            very simple and straightforward
                            captions enabled me to keep these details in mind in the future should I endeavor to design
                            a website. </p>

                    <li>
                        <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how
                            the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                        <p> My favorite inspiration was the easygoapp.io preview for a few reasons. I really liked the
                            way they formatted the top of the app to
                            incidate the crops users are growing with complementary colors and images of the crops
                            themselves. I
                            also found it satisfying how the designers animated each crop (i.e. tomato) so that when
                            users slide left and right,
                            the image slides with the transition. I also thought making the fonts for the top half
                            generally bigger was ideal as
                            users can immediately view the crop they're on and its the fundamental stats as kind of a
                            initial gist of how their crop is doing
                            before sliding further down the app to get a detailed description. </p>

                        <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain
                            why.</p>
                        <p> I would rate this article a 9/10. As a (hella) visual person I basically ate up the greater
                            majority
                            of the GIFs like a amateur user, but I was also found inspiring being able to directly see
                            different transitions
                            and animations for different elements of different websites. There were a few transitions
                            within the GIFs I didn't like
                            as much as I thought they were rather unnecessary such as the Travel Map preview (with each
                            click I found
                            the animations to be a bit excessive). </p>
