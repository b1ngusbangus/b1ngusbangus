					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned the importance of considering your audience when it comes to typography. I already had
								the general sense that knowing how to style different fonts together is important but didn't think of it as far as 
								typography having to do with children or seniors. For one, I did not know that a whole font was invented after scientific
								studying and analysis on what kinds of fonts children are able to discern and learn best from. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was where the author expanded upon improving one's typography skills by 
								providing visual examples throughout the article. I am particularly a visual learner, and so seeing all
								of these nice examples following the author's points of the article tied their whole argument more nicely
								and concretely. They also further helped me to consider all the points they were making. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "When choosing type, take into account your audience and their needs. Simply put, empathize with your users." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I would give this article a 7/10. It was good how detailed and particular the author was with their different poitns in 
								improving one's typography skills; however, the article's tone didn't have as much of a quirky feel as some of the other articles
								I've read before--it felt more strictly instructional. </p>
