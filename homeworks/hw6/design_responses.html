						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned of the importance of moving certain elements differently depending on the circumstances.
								More specifically, the animation of objects should generally be quick in order to avoid annoyance and impatience among
								users. For example, making objects move more naturally equates to adding an accelerating and decelerating effect on it
								as all objects in the real world move in that same fashion.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was where the article stressed not to use motion blur when it comes to adding
								animation effects on objects. I have personally found myself cringing to objects with motion blur effects on them
								whenever I would come across such websites or applications that included this effect in their interface. This might
								sound mean but it felt good to be validated by a Medium article that motion blur on objects is not the move--it's just
								not cute at all. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "For the animation not to look mechanical and artificial, the object should move with some acceleration or deceleration â€” 
								just like all live objects in the physical world." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I would give this article a 7.5/10. I thought the author provided pretty useful information regarding object animations especially
								for those who are coming in with little to no experience. The article is very throrough and elaborates in fine detail various things
								that should and shouldn't be considered when animating objects for web or app design, and why. However, I found the article to be
								slightly pedantic as the elaborations sometimes felt a bit too technical for certain things that felt more intuitive and didn't need
								that much explanation in detail. </p>
